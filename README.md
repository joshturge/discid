# discid

discid will generate an id from a disc's TOC using the MusicBrainz discid library. This ID can then be used on [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org) and [FreeDB](http://www.freedb.org/) to get metadata on the disc. More info [here](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Disc_ID).

I made this little program as I want to not only keep a record of music files I own but also the disc id's so I can pull metadata from MusicBrainz and FreeDB

## Install

I have included a shell script for installing the required library [libdiscid](https://github.com/metabrainz/libdiscid) and building from source.
